Basically, this is the 2017 dollar-store knockoff of VideoTube â€” slapped together in mostly JavaScript, because apparently thatâ€™s all I knew back then.

I keep it around like an embarrassing high school yearbook photoâ€¦ I just donâ€™t have the heart to delete it.

There are two methods for getting started with this repo.


Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/simeon20/Sims-videoTube
> cd Sims-videoTube-master 
> npm install
> npm start
```


https://github.com/simeon20/ReduxSimpleStarter then download the .zip file.  Extract the contents of the zip file, then open your terminal, change to the project directory, and:

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
